# BlockOverflow: Learn Python with Minecraft

## 📌 Overview  
Welcome to **BlockOverflow**! This project leverages **Minecraft** as an interactive medium for teaching **computer science principles in Python**. Using **[Evocraft-py](https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py)** (added as a submodule from the official repository), we enable **programmatic control of Minecraft** to visualize algorithms, generate structures, and demonstrate coding concepts in a fun, engaging way.

## 🚀 Features & Goals  
- 🎮 **Minecraft Integration** – Use Python code to interact with Minecraft.
- 📚 **CS Concepts** – Learn sorting, search algorithms, recursion, and more.
- 🏠 **Interactive Learning** – Build visual representations of algorithms.
- 🞩 **Educational Videos** – Embedded video tutorials for hands-on learning.

## 🔗 Setup Instructions  

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository (including submodules)  
Since **Evocraft-py** is included as a submodule from the **official repository**, clone it using:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/real-itu/Evocraft-py.git BlockOverflow
```
If you've already cloned without submodules, initialize it manually:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Start Minecraft and Run Scripts  
1. Launch a **Minecraft server** that supports `Evocraft-py`.  
2. Run Python scripts to interact with Minecraft! Example:
   ```bash
   python search_algorithms.py
   ```

## 📌 Implemented & Planned Features  

### ✅ **1. Search Algorithms (Implemented)**  
Search algorithms are crucial in computer science for finding data efficiently. Here, we visualize search methods using **blocks in Minecraft**.

#### 🔍 Implemented Search Methods:  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Greedy Search**
- **Jump Point Search**

#### 🎥 **Video Demonstration:**

### ⏳ **2. Sorting Algorithms (Coming Soon)**  
Sorting algorithms will be demonstrated by **placing, swapping, and sorting Minecraft blocks**.  
#### Planned Implementations:
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Radix Sort**

#### 🎥 **Video Demonstration (Coming Soon!)**  
🖐 *Video will be added soon! Stay tuned!*
